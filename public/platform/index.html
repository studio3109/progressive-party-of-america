                          <h3 id="_from-corporate-greed-to-human-need_"><em>From Corporate Greed to Human Need</em></h3>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>In 1776, our nation united against tyranny and oppression to declare independence from the British Empire. This moment marked the beginning of our journey toward securing life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all Americans. While our constitution was created to ensure the well-being of our people and safeguard our freedoms, we currently face significant inequality. The top one percent of income earners possess thirty percent of our wealth, while the bottom fifty percent own less than three percent. Corporations can silence whistleblowers with impunity, the two-party system opposes any potential alternatives, and the rights of the working class are consistently disregarded and eroded.</p>
<p>This system has been repeated for years by the two party duopoly, with no end in sight. Our problems only get worse, while the corporations get richer, and our leaders care more about their money to fund their re-election campaigns than actually serving the people. The system isn’t broken, the system is working exactly as intended - and this is why our country needs a new party, and a new kind of leader to head our state and government. One that is willing to fight for our rights, our values, and our people. One that is willing to change the country, and the rest of the world, for the better.</p>
<p>Sydney Satalino is running for President in 2040, and launching her own party beforehand, so the two-party system can fall, so the will of the corporations won’t have an iron grip over our country anymore, and so the will of the people will be respected once more, giving our country life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness once again. When she is in power as President of the United States , she promises a better world for everyone. Human rights for all. A cooperative and equal economy for everyone. A world of peace for every person to live in. And bringing our country’s priorities from corporate greed to human need.</p>
<h2 id="ending-corporate-and-government-corruption">Ending Corporate and Government Corruption</h2>
<p>When elected President of the United States, Ms. Satalino’s number one priority was to end the corruption that has invaded our government and the corporations that use politicians as puppets for their self-interest. The people of the United States of America have been forgotten by the people who took an oath to serve them and defend the Constitution, because both major political parties, as well as several minor ones and independent candidates, are well-funded by corporations and their rich benefactors who only encourage them to create change that their CEOs will approve of, not tangible change that will create a lasting future in this country.</p>
<p>Ms. Satalino knows that a nation built on corporate bribery and lobbying isn’t a country that is truly for We The People, and she has made it her mission to bring this nation, for the first time in history, to the words that it was founded on, forcing the politicians that we vote for and our taxes pay for to do the jobs that we, the people, expect them to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>End Corporate-Funded Lobbying, Super PACs, and Corporate
Donations to Politicians</li>
</ul>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino and her Progressive Party majority across Congress and state legislatures will pass legislation that forbids corporate-funded lobbying, corporate funding of Super PACS, and corporate donations to politicians. Individual donations to politicians will be limited to $1,000 a year, self-funding campaigns will be limited to $500,000 a year, and it will be deemed illegal for corporate executives to force employees to donate to a particular candidate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Outlaw Dark Money</li>
</ul>
<p>Dark money has plagued politics for too long, allowing anonymous donors to pump money into the two-party system and stop progress from occurring. In her anti-corruption amendment that she will pass as President of the United States, Ms. Satalino will make it clear that all political donations, even to non-candidate groups, must have their donors disclosed.</p>
<ul>
<li>End Insider Trading and Gifts to Congresspeople/Supreme Court
Justices</li>
</ul>
<p>The practice of insider trading, where Congresspeople and members of the Supreme Court can use confidential information they learn at their jobs to buy stock in companies that will benefit from their decisions, and physical gifts to Congresspeople and Supreme Court members, such as lavish trips to certain members of the Supreme Court have gotten to influence decisions, are also another major piece of the corrupt system that Congresspeople and the Supreme Court are apart of that puts the voices of the wealthy over the voices of the needy. As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino will end this corrupt system, passing a law with her pro-people Progressive majority to ban Congresspeople and Supreme Court justices from personally benefiting from their own decisions in these ways.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-cooperative-and-equitable-economy">Building a Cooperative and Equitable Economy</h2>
<p>Twelve corporations own 91% of the food supply in America. Six corporations own 90% of the media in America. The real estate, clothing, beauty, tourism, sports, entertainment, restaurant, retail, energy, automobile, agriculture, oil, gas, construction, defense, and pharmaceutical industries, among others, are all bogged down by corporate consolidation and control, leaving the people of the United States with no real choice, sky-high prices, a lacking job market, and the struggle of small business owners to compete with the big corporations.</p>
<p>As a people-first President and the first President to not be beholden to the
duopoly in centuries, Ms. Satalino wants to fight for the working class, not
the corporations that control their lives. She is not afraid to bust a monopolistic industry to bring down prices and make things more equitable
for small businesses. She is not afraid to fight tooth and nail so Americans
can make ends meet. And she is prepared to take on the corporations who
would do everything to make sure her movement fails - and win.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking Apart Monopolies</li>
</ul>
<p>As previously stated, the American economy is concentrated with the same corporate owners owning entire industries, making prices skyrocket and small businesses and rank-and-le employees suffer. As the head figure of the executive branch, Ms. Satalino’s Federal Trade Commission will be the most aggressive it has been in the agency’s history, breaking apart conglomerates in the food, media, real estate, consumer product, construction, retail, utility, and drug monopolies that currently dominate the American economy, as well as any other major monopolies that are not listed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving Down Prices</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to increasing corporate consolidation, prices have been higher than
ever, with many Americans being forced to spend hundreds of dollars on
grocery bills a month and thousands more just to survive. Thanks to Ms.
Satalino’s Federal Trade Commission, as well as legislation to create a new
federal agency dedicated to monitoring prices before and after crises and
cracking down on those who use the crisis to unfairly jack up prices, prices
for all goods across all industries will fall, giving Americans more security
when it comes to spending their money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Encourage Small Business Ownership</li>
</ul>
<p>Our small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, accounting for only 44% of profits, but 66% of new American jobs. As a former small business owner herself, Ms. Satalino understands that if our small businesses are supported instead of big corporations, the economy will thrive, and lives will be positively impacted for the better. To encourage small business ownership, Ms. Satalino will cut taxes for small businesses, subsidize job growth for small businesses, use small businesses for all federal contracts, make it easier for small business owners to navigate the red tape that comes with starting one, and mandate that products from small businesses fill at least 40% of American stores.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Jobs</li>
</ul>
<p>As corporate consolidation and AI advancement continues, more Americans have been losing jobs than ever, which has been causing them to struggle. In addition to breaking up monopolies and championing small businesses, Ms. Satalino aspires to break the record of jobs created during any presidency, and she plans to achieve it by creating massive public works projects to create a national high-speed public rail system, x every broken road in America by 2050, initiatives to build more housing and a universal food distribution system, cutting payroll taxes and increasing wages for all Americans.</p>
<h2 id="human-rights-for-all">Human Rights For All</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most well-known phrases from the United States Declaration of Independence is “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness”, an early declaration of human rights that has been echoed throughout our nation’s history. However, thanks to the corporate duopoly and its mark on American politics, the inalienable rights of Americans, as well as the rights of any human period, have been trampled on. Constitutionally mandated rights have been curtailed, freedoms and human necessities have been denied to the people, and most frustratingly, the rights of corporations have been respected more than the rights of the common man.</p>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino wants to oversee the biggest
expansion of human rights in American history. She wants to ensure that every person in the United States of America can keep their Constitutional rights, be secure with newly-recognized rights to protect against discrimination, have necessary resources, a good, free education, a clean environment, freedom, good health, peace in our nation, and rights for the workers in this nation, and overall, experience more liberty than they ever have had in the United States of America so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Constitutionally Mandated Rights</li>
</ul>
<p>Many amendments in the United States Constitution, such as the 1st amendment, 2nd Amendment, 4th Amendment, and 8th Amendment, have been curtailed by laws that have sought to silence the free speech, assembly, and press of the American people, take the right to bear arms away from the people, cruelly punish the people and unnecessary surveil the people.</p>
<p>In addition to fiercely defending the rest of the United States Constitution
as President, Ms. Satalino will open up the right to free speech, gut any overreaching restrictions to free assembly, freedom of the press, and the right to bear arms, abolish the death penalty, close any United States torture camps, end excessive surveillance of the American people, and set a
gun safety program which will license gun owners after vast background checks and a gun safety test to curb gun violence without infringing on Second Amendment rights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights for the Marginalized</li>
</ul>
<p>Marginalized people in the United States of America, including people of color, women, the LGBTQ+ community, the disabled, and religious minorities, have faced many barriers to success and true equality in this country. As a disabled, neurodivergent queer woman, this issue is important to Ms. Satalino, and she doesn’t want to use her position as the first openly autistic, openly LGBTQ+, and one of the first female presidents to do nothing for her communities.</p>
<p>In addition to more extensive non-discrimination laws, Ms. Satalino plans to
end racist gerrymandering and redlining policies, empower minority-owned small businesses, protect women’s health, end the pink tax for the period and women’s healthcare products, codify Obergefell v. Hodges into federal law, end conversion therapy nationwide, protect transgender Americans’ right to healthcare and to live without discrimination, end the subminimum wage for disabled workers, implement restorative justice in schools, close the Judge Rotenberg Center and other abusive facilities for disabled people, designate Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, Passover, Diwali, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha as national paid-time off holidays, and combat discrimination and hatred of marginalized groups in everything she does.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights to Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Food should be a human right. Fresh water should be a human right. Housing, electricity, and utilities should also be human rights, which is why as President of the United States, Ms. Satalino plans to declare food, water,
housing, electricity, and utilities human rights, and end hunger and homelessness in the United States by setting up programs that will allow
millions of houses a year to be built, making drastic rent hikes illegal,
building food distribution centers all across the United States, building
grocery stores in food deserts, making all school meals free, and funding
massive construction projects to address homelessness.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights to Education</li>
</ul>
<p>As a student in a public school district, Ms. Satalino noticed the disparities in quality education that public schools offered, as well as the censorship regarding learning material that the state school districts offered, often politically motivated. She also had to face a school board that was hostile to her own experience as an openly LGBTQ+ student in the South, and she noticed how schools were run by partisan boards for political gain.</p>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino will end the disparities in
public education, giving Americans of all backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and racial groups equally-funded education funded by a new corporate tax, not property tax. She will end censorship in public schools,
working with states to create a fully-formed curriculum that doesn’t hold
back from the ugly parts of our country’s history. She will create programs
to help marginalized students and will work to ensure that schools are overseen by teachers and principals, not partisan school boards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights to a Clean Environment</li>
</ul>
<p>A clean environment is one of the many things that corporate greed has taken from the people of America, as big oil and gas companies worked to prevent the world from finding out about climate change before it was too late. More recently, the corporate parties have made environmental posturing, doing the bare minimum to ensure a clean environment, but their true alliance is with the polluters, leaving temperatures rising and natural disasters becoming more common.</p>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino will do whatever she can to
stop global warming, reduce emissions, and hold oil and gas companies accountable for their role in the climate crisis. She and her Progressive Party majority will pass a carbon tax applicable to corporations and the wealthy, build eco-friendly walkable cities across the United States, create a nationwide high-speed train system to reduce car dependency, and work to transition American energy from fossil fuels to more environmentally-conscious solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights to Health</li>
</ul>
<p>America is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not have free public healthcare. As a diabetic woman who has to pay hundreds of extra dollars a month just to get the medicine she survives, Ms. Satalino knows the pain of America’s absurdly high healthcare prices all too well, and this is why she supports creating a national universal healthcare system that won’t cost Americans a penny. Additionally, building more hospitals, addressing the nursing and doctor shortage, and reducing emergency room waiting room times is something that Ms. Satalino aspires to accomplish in her presidency, and she hopes she and her Progressive Party majority can
achieve that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights to Peace</li>
</ul>
<p>Over 50,000 Americans and many more people across the world have been killed due to endless war and the current foreign policy that prioritizes violence over diplomacy, bullets over words. This has affected many families, and the trauma of war has also affected millions more who survived. As the granddaughter of a Vietnam veteran, Ms. Satalino believes that to give Americans the most freedom possible, we must put the right to peace in action through a new kind of foreign policy - one that seeks compassion and understanding over wars conducted for protfit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights to Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>This century, everyday Americans have been the targets of massive surveillance projects by their government, threatening the privacy of these
individuals. The people of this nation deserve to have their privacy back,
which is why as President of the United States, Ms. Satalino will champion
ending restrictive laws that allow the government to spy on their citizens
without cause and clarifying the right to privacy in the United States
Constitution.</p>
<h2 id="ensuring-economic-equality">Ensuring Economic Equality</h2>
<p>As the daughter of a single mom and entrepreneur, Ms. Satalino has experienced firsthand what it’s like to live in a country where economic equality and equal opportunity are promised, but never delivered on. She knows that most of the wealth that is generated in this country is kept hostage by the rich and the corporations, and not given to the people whose
labor and hard work have generated the wealth that our country enjoys. Ms. Satalino hopes to be elected President of the United States so that she can serve the people. Not the 1%, not Wall Street or Silicon Valley elites. Not
the wealthy billionaires who control politics right now, who keep the money generated from our economy hostage. She wants to fight for the working and middle class, for the average person, and the common man, and that is why she hopes to enact these policies to ensure economic equality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowering Taxes for the Working and Middle Class</li>
</ul>
<p>The average middle-class family spends 30% of their income on taxes, while the richest Americans can only spend 8.2% of their income on taxes due to tax loopholes. While the working and middle class have their hard work ripped away by this unfair balance of taxes, the richest of the rich get away
with paying next to nothing due to government handouts and corporate tax
cuts.</p>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino is determined to end this
unfair tax distribution, and it starts with slashing taxes for the working and middle class. She plans to work with local and state governments to lower
the taxes working and middle-class families have to pay, and on the federal
side, plans to lower the tax rates for any Americans making under $100,000.
She also plans to end taxes on alimony and other benets that result from divorce and work with the IRS to simplify the tax code and make it easier
for Americans to pay their taxes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Closing Tax Loopholes for the Wealthy</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many tax loopholes that the wealthy exploit to avoid paying their
fair share in taxes, and Ms. Satalino is determined to end them. First, she
wants to ensure that all top businesses are incorporated in their actual state of origin, not just a state where they can get away with paying less taxes or a country where they can avoid paying taxes by having their money
offshore. She plans on ending holes in estate tax, the deprecation loophole,
tax breaks, and government assistants for big corporations and Roth IRAs, taxing deductions for business expenses for big corporations, investments, property gains, yachts, second homes, stock market investments, capital gains, and sports team ownership. She also plans on investigating foundations that billionaires set up and claim to be for charity, but use as a way to get income tax-free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing Minimum Wage to the Consumer Price Index</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum wage in the United States of America has not changed since 2009. However, inflation changes the cost of living constantly, and politicians never change the minimum wage, to the point where an increase that has been debated for nearly a decade isn’t enough to cover the cost of living anymore.</p>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino plans to fix the minimum wage to the cost of living as provided by the Consumer Price Index and have
it rise with inflation. This will prevent prolonged debates over the minimum
wage, as well as provide economic security and economic equality to all the
people in the United States.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthen Unemployment and Financial Security</li>
</ul>
<p>Unemployment and layoffs are starting to become more common and rampant than ever, thanks to unchecked corporate greed and automation, as well as outsourcing cheaper labor to foreign companies, taking American jobs. To combat this, Ms. Satalino plans to strengthen our nation’s unemployment relief and nancial security programs, giving the people of the United States a safety net as they look for their next job.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive Down Inflation</li>
</ul>
<p>Inflation is an issue that many Americans feel the impact of every day, but
the government hasn’t done much to combat it. As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino plans to combat inflation as much as possible, directing
the Federal Reserve to manage economic instability by any means necessary, to keep the economy and the people of the United States prosperous.</p>
<h2 id="from-a-world-of-war-to-a-war-of-peace">From A World of War to A War of Peace</h2>
<p>Since 1776, the United States of America has only been at peace for 17 of nearly 250 years. Every other year, the nation has been involved in war, either a profit-based war for oil or another natural resource, a regime-change war, funding another country’s war, or a plain old war that could have been prevented by acts of diplomacy. Our budget that could be spent more responsibly is dominated by military spending unmatched by no other nation, and even if the military budget decreased by half, we would still have the largest military in the world.</p>
<p>When she is elected President of the United States, turning the page on a history full of war and writing a new era for the nation, one where conflict is solved by words instead of bullets, with aggressive diplomacy instead of endless war, is one of Ms. Satalino’s greatest priorities. She is aware of the amount of influence the presidency has on the nation’s foreign policy and the world at large, and while serving as Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces and the country’s chief diplomat, she seeks to make her mark on the world, creating lasting change that will bring the world to an unprecedented era of peace.</p>
<ul>
<li>More Responsible Government Spending</li>
</ul>
<p>The budget of the United States government is spent wastefully, with the military-industrial complex overcharging the Pentagon for parts, the government spending money on unnecessary weapons at exorbitant prices, and a defense strategy with hundreds of bases abroad. There is other wasteful spending as well, such as $6 million to boost Egyptian tourism, $200 million to rich musicians as part of a small business program, and using COVID relief funds to build an 800-room luxury hotel.</p>
<p>As President of the United States, Ms. Satalino plans to audit the Pentagon and every other government agency, slash wasteful spending on war and other matters, and ultimately, free up more money in our budget to spend on her number one priority: the people.</p>
<ul>
<li>End Endless War</li>
</ul>
<p>The United States military is currently fighting a naval front in the Israel-Hamas War and has been intervening in the Syrian Civil War since 2014, the Somali Civil War since 2007, and Yemen since 2002. In addition, the United States is currently sending weapons to Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan, and many other countries, in the name of national security. While it is important to keep Americans and the world safe, these wars have accomplished very little, instead harming Americans and citizens of other countries instead of bringing peace.</p>
<p>As President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces, Ms. Satalino will serve with one goal: to end endless war. She will seek resolutions to all the conflicts America is currently involved in, aggressively negotiate to bring peace to the world and use the United States’s leverage in foreign affairs for good, with the ambitious goal of bringing America to a period of peace that hasn’t been seen in quite some time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the Influence of the Military-Industrial Complex</li>
</ul>
<p>The military-industrial complex has been highly influential in American society, lobbying politicians to keep wars going and keeping the American military budget high by charging the Pentagon high prices for contracts they do not need. Through the anti-corruption legislation that she hopes to pass and her audits of the Pentagon that will keep the agency from overspending, Ms. Satalino aims to reduce the influence of the military-industrial complex, making the American military stronger and more effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop Arming Repressive Regimes</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout our nation’s history, American-made bombs and weapons have been sent to regimes that bomb innocent civilians and commit human rights atrocities. Our support of these governments has only sought to further embolden their crimes against civilians, which is why as Commander-in-Chief, Ms. Satalino will immediately halt any arms sales to repressive regimes that only want to use our support for their human rights violations or genocides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peace-First Foreign Policy</li>
</ul>
<p>When the United States is faced with a conflict, the thing that the government usually does is either go to war or fund a war where an ally fights an adversary. There is little to no progress made on the foreign policy front this way, however, which is why as President of the United States, Ms. Satalino will anchor her foreign policy in an ideology of being “peace-first”, meaning that starting or funding a war will only be a last resort, and all diplomatic methods will be exhausted to end conflicts before a single bomb is funded. If war is the only option, however, it will not be dragged out, and a peaceful resolution will be aggressively sought.</p>
